Future
------

- implement fromjson somehow?
- ignore some fields when finding conflicts
- regex replace (re.sub)
- replace, replaceall - convenience function to convert replacing a single value
- categorise/classify - convenient way to extend table with a classification field? or just use extend with function? example, convert continuous variable to categorical variable using custom ranges
- sampling for pivot, avoid two complete passes
- to and from compressed files
- alpha facet?
- partitioning of alpha fields?
- code smells in reduce functions - refactor with generic grouper and reducer functions?
- implement string patterns as utility function
- implement hash (lookup) alternatives to all join and other sort-dependent functions
- implement provenance trace
- implement petl.interactive with cache wrappers
- implement petl.fluent
- implement validator module based on csvvalidator
- implement filldown
- implement fillup
- implement fillright? 
- implement fillleft?
- implement rowgroupby? generate sequence of key/row iterator pairs?
- implement recordgroupby?
- show rows/values causing conversion or translation errors
- optimised implementation of merge() where input files are presorted? I.e., avoid need to concatenate then sort the concatenation, rather just do the merge sort then reduce
