        ## Problem description

        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!
        Please erase example text in all fields bellow and fill with details of the bug you have found.
  - type: textarea
    id: what-happened
    attributes:
      label: What happened?
      description: |
        Please explain:
        - what the current output/behavior is
        - what's the bug is preventing you from doing
        - tell if it had worked before but regressed and stopped working
      placeholder: Please, tell us a clear and concise description of what the bug is and how it manifests.
      value: |
        Example:
          When performing a specific operation using petl function XYZ, the folloing warning is emitted:
            DeprecationWarning: ABC is deprecated since Python 3.9 and will be removed in a subsequent version.
            The only supported action are: other, alternative, and something else.
          Furthermore, when using the same code on another context, I get this error instead:
            Error: Something got wrong somewhere!

    id: expected-behavior
    attributes:
      label: What is the expected behavior?
      description: |
        Please explain:
        - what did you expect to happen.
        - how the current behavior doesn't match the intended behavior.
      placeholder: Please, tell us what did you expect to happen, what's the intended behavior.
      value: |
        Example:
          I would expect to be able to use petl for doing the operation I need to do. 
          In the current iteration, that is only possible if I do not use the other petl functionality.
          Other operations, like working around the issue and doing somenthin else, also do not work. 
          I've tried using other function as well, but it didn't change anything.
